    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Our company, Alglow, is a skin-care business specializing in beauty nourishment products, such as sunscreens, moisturizers, facial creams, etc. from laboratory-based marine algae. Our research shows that mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are known for their natural compounds that block harmful ultraviolet radiation once utilized in skin-care. Therefore, enabling users to establish a healthier skin tone by protecting their skin from the sun, as well as providing their skins with hydration, nourishment and antioxidants.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement & Solution</h2>
    <p>As you all should know, most of the sunscreens sold in the market often utilize chemical compounds that can irritate skin, disrupt hormones, and contribute to the deterioration of marine life. Statistics have shown that the mineral-based options leave white casts on skin with a heavy, greasy feeling, thereby marking an inconvenience that can make users feel uncomfortable.</p>
    <p>Hence, requiring the use of products from Alglow to combat these disadvantages. Here, at Alglow, we will utilize the natural compounds in marine algae that will be grown in a controlled environment in our laboratory, producing safe and effective skin-care products, like sunscreens, with high SPF that will both help public skin and the ecosystem. If there were to be any problems with our products or price range, then Alglow will ensure that any challenges will be met in any way possible.</p>
